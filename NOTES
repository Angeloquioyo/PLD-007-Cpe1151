BASIC CONCEPTS 
COMPUTER HARDWARE = is composed of the following components: Central processing uniw (CPU), Input devices, output devices, primary storage, secondary storage, and communication devices.
Input devices = ACCEPT DATA & INSTRUCTIONS and convert them to a form that the computer can understand.
BINARY COMPUTERS = are based on integrated circuits (chips), each of which includes millions of subminiature transistors. Each transistor can be in either an 'on' or 'off' state that is used to establish a binary 1 or 0 for strong one BINARY DIGIT, or DIGIT.
Evolution of Computer Hardware:
FIRST GENERATION = from 1946 to 1956, used vacuum tubes to store and process information
SECOND GENERATION = 1957-1963, used transistors for storing and processing information.
THIRD GENERATION = 
LATE FOURTH GENERATION = 1996 to the present, use grand-scale integrated circuits to store and process information.
FIFTH GENERATION = 
TYPES OF COMPUTER:
SUPERCOMPUTER = with the MOST PROCESSING POWER. the primary application of supercomputers has been in scientific and military work.
MAINFRAMES = are NOT as powerful and generally not as expensive as supercomputers.
MINICOMPUTERS = 
SERVERS = typically support computer networks, enabling users to share files, software, peripheal devices and other network resources.
WORKSTATIONS = provide high levels of performance to technical users such as designers and are typically based on RISC
CPU: CONTROL UNIT, AREA UNIT, PRIMARY/MEMORY UNIT
